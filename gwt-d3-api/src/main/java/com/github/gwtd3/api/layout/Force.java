/**
 * A force-directed layout with the default settings: size 1×1, link strength 1, friction 0.9, distance 20, charge
 * strength -30, gravity strength 0.1, and theta parameter 0.8. The default nodes and links are the empty array, and
 * when the layout is started, the internal alpha cooling parameter is set to 0.1. The general pattern for constructing
 * force-directed layouts is to set all the configuration properties, and then call start: <br>
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * var force = d3.layout.force() .nodes(nodes) .links(links) .size([w, h])
 * .start();
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * Note that, like D3's other layouts, the force-directed layout doesn't mandate a particular visual representation.
 * Most commonly, nodes are mapped to SVG circle elements, and links are mapped to SVG line elements. But you might also
 * display nodes as symbols or images.

     * Starts the simulation; this method must be called when the layout is
     * first created, after assigning the nodes and links. In addition, it
     * should be called again whenever the nodes or links change. Internally,
     * the layout uses a cooling parameter alpha which controls the layout
     * temperature: as the physical simulation converges on a stable layout, the
     * temperature drops, causing nodes to move more slowly. Eventually, alpha
     * drops below a threshold and the simulation stops completely, freeing the
     * CPU and avoiding battery drain. The layout can be reheated using {@link #resume()} or by restarting; this happens
     * automatically when using the {@link #drag()} behavior. <br>
     * <p>
     * On start, the layout initializes various attributes on the associated nodes. The index of each node is computed
     * by iterating over the array, starting at zero. The initial x and y coordinates, if not already set externally to
     * a valid number, are computed by examining neighboring nodes: if a linked node already has an initial position in
     * x or y, the corresponding coordinates are applied to the new node. This increases the stability of the graph
     * layout when new nodes are added, rather than using the default which is to initialize the position randomly
     * within the layout's size. The previous px and py position is set to the initial position, if not already set,
     * giving new nodes an initial velocity of zero. Finally, the fixed boolean defaults to false. <br>
     * <p>
     * The layout also initializes the source and target attributes on the associated links: for convenience, these
     * attributes may be specified as a numeric index rather than a direct link, such that the nodes and links can be
     * read-in from a JSON file or other static description that may not allow circular linking. The source and target
     * attributes on incoming links are only replaced with the corresponding entries in nodes if these attributes are
     * numbers; thus, these attributes on existing links are unaffected when the layout is restarted. The
     * {@link #linkDistance()} and {@link #linkStrength()} are also computed on start.
